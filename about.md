### what am i?
I'm an Infosec professional, focusing on incident response, and alert development. #blueteam

My day to day tools include Splunk, Sysmon, Powershell, and Python.

### why blog?
This blog is designed mostly for my own reference, but perhaps someone else will find the documented solutions useful. 

### why github pages?
* Medium gets mixed reviews and content exports look challenging
* I found [jekyllnow](http://jekyllnow.com), which gets rid of the Ruby requirements to build a Github pages site (with a tradeoff of some decreased flexibility). I really want to spend my time on content, not on setting up a blog.
